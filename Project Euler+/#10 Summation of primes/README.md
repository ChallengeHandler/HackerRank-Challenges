# Summation of primes

## Problem

The sum of the primes below $10$ is $2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17$.

Find the sum of all the primes not greater than given $N$.

**Input format**

The first line contains an integer $T$ i.e. number of test cases.<br/>
The next $T$ lines will contain an integer $N$.

**Constraints**

- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$

**Output Format**

Print the value corresponding to each test case in separate line.

**Sample Input 0**
```
2
5
10
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
10
17
```

**Explanation 0**

- For $N = 5$, we have primes as $\{2, 3, 5\}$ and the sum is $10$.
- For $N = 10$, we have primes as $\{2, 3, 5, 7\}$ and the sum is $17$.
