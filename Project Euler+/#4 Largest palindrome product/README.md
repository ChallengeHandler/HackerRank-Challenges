# Largest palindrome product

## Problem

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is <br/>
$101101 = 143 \times 707$

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than $N$.

**Input format**

First line contains $T$ that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by $T$ lines, each containing an integer, $N$.

**Constraints**

- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $101101 < N < 1000000$

**Output Format**

Print the required answer for each test case in a new line. 

**Sample Input 0**
```
2
101110
800000
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
101101
793397
```

**Explanation 0**

- $101101$ is product of $143$ and $707$.
- $793397$ is product of $869$ and $913$.
