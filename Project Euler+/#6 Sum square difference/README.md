# Sum square difference

## Problem

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, $1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + 10^2 = 385$. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, $(1 + 2 + \dots + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$. Hence the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.

Find the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first $N$ natural numbers and the square of the sum.

**Input format**

First line contains $T$ that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by $T$ lines, each containing an integer, $N$.

**Constraints**

- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^4$

**Output Format**

Print the required answer for each test case.

**Sample Input 0**
```
2
3
10
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
22
2640
```

**Explanation 0**

- For $N = 3$, $(1 + 2 + 3)^2 - (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) \Rightarrow 22$
- For $N = 10$, $(1 + 2 + \dots + 10)^2 - (1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + 10^2) \Rightarrow 2640$
