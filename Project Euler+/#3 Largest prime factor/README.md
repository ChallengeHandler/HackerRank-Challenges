What is the largest prime factor of a given number $N$?

**Input format**

First line contains $T$, the number of test cases. This is followed by $T$ lines, each containing an integer, $N$.

**Constraints**

- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $10 \leq N \leq 10^{12}$

**Output Format**

For each test case, display the largest prime factor of $N$.

**Sample Input 0**
```
2
10
17
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
5
17
```

**Explanation 0**
